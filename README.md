# Personalized Web Page / Resume

This project showcases my curriculum vitae (CV) along with a selection of personal projects. Developed using Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a sleek, modern aesthetic, it leverages Sanity.io as the Content Management System (CMS) to ensure content is easily manageable and dynamically updated.

## Project Overview
This project is split into two main directories, each serving a distinct purpose:

- `ertkjern-sanity`: This directory houses the Sanity CMS configuration and content. It's where all the textual and multimedia content is managed, making it easy to update the CV and project details without touching the codebase.
- `ertkjern-web`: Contains the source code for the Next.js website. This is where the web application is developed, styled using Tailwind CSS for responsiveness and aesthetic appeal.

## Getting Started
To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system before proceeding.

Note: Repeat the installation and run steps for both directories to get both the CMS and web application running locally.
